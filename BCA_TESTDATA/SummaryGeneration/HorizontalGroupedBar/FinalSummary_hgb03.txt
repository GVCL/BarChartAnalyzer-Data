The plot depicts a Horizontal Grouped Bar Graph illustrating BOD concentration in river water.  The plot is between Month on y-axis over BOD concentration on the x-axis for station 1, station 2, and station 3.  The BOD concentration of station 1 are 6.4, 5.62, 5.32, 6.91, 4.81, and 3.41 for the Month may, July, September, November, January, and march respectively.  The BOD concentration of station 2 are 5.8, 5.86, 11.1, 6.46, 5.05, and 4.33 for the Month may, July, September, November, January, and march respectively.  The BOD concentration of station 3 are 8.91, 3.44, 3.77, 4.18, 3.26, and 4.87 for the Month may, July, September, November, January, and march respectively.
	 The BOD concentration difference between station 2 and station 3 starts with -3 at Month may the minimum value, then increases till September the maximum value, and ends with a decreasing trend till march.  The standard deviation values of BOD concentration for categories 'station 1', station 2', and 'station 3' are 1.13, 2.19, and 1.94 respectively.
