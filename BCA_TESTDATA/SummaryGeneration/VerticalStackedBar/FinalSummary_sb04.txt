The plot depicts a Vertical Stacked Bar Graph illustrating Rating of player aspects.  The plot is between Rating out of 100 on the y-axis over Players on the x-axis for acceleration, sprint speed, balance, shot power, jumping, and stamina.  The Rating out of 100 of acceleration has its maximum and minimum values 95 and 44 at 3, and 10 respectively.  The Rating out of 100 of sprintspeed has its maximum and minimum values 90 and 57 at 2, and 4 respectively.  The Rating out of 100  balance starts with 94 at Players 1 the maximum value, then declines till 2, followed by an increasing trend till 3, followed by a decreasing trend till 4 the minimum value, and ends with a decreasing trend till 10.  The Rating out of 100  shot powers has its maximum and minimum values 96 and 23 at 2, and 10 respectively.  The Rating out of 100 by jumping has its maximum and minimum values 95 and 56 at 2, and 6 respectively.  The Rating out of 100 of stamina has its maximum and minimum values 90 and 40 at 5, and 10 respectively.
	 The Rating out of 100 of all categories cumulatively has its maximum and minimum values 530 and 293 at 2, and 10 respectively.  The standard deviation values of Rating out of 100 for categories 'acceleration', sprintspeed', balance, ', shot power', jumping', and 'stamina' are 15.96, 11.14, 17.36, 23.83, 12.12, and 18.0 respectively.  The categories 'acceleration' and 'sprintspeed' are positively correlated.  All except for 10 the Rating out of 100  'sprintspeed' is lesser than ''acceleration'.  The categories 'acceleration' and 'balance' are positively correlated.  The categories 'sprintspeed' and 'shot power' are positively correlated.
