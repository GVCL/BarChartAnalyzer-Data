The plot depicts a Vertical Stacked Bar Graph illustrating Rating of players aspects. The plot is between Rating out of 100 on y-axis over Players on the x-axis for acceleration, sprintspeed, balance, shotpower, jumping, and stamina. The range of 'Players' values are 1 to 10. The 'acceleration' range from 44.58 to 95.42, with a standard deviation of 15.96. The 'sprintspeed' range from 57.8 to 90.34, with a standard deviation of 11.14. The 'balance' range from 42.54 to 94.41, with a standard deviation of 17.36. The 'shotpower' range from 23.22 to 96.44, with a standard deviation of 23.83. The 'jumping' range from 56.78 to 95.42, with a standard deviation of 12.12. The 'stamina' range from 40.51 to 90.34, with a standard deviation of 18.0. The categories 'acceleration' and 'sprintspeed' are positively correlated by 0.81 Spearman rank correlation. All except for 10 'sprintspeed' is lesser than ''acceleration'. The categories 'acceleration' and 'balance' are positively correlated by 0.76 Spearman rank correlation. The categories 'sprintspeed' and 'shotpower' are positively correlated by 0.7 Spearman rank correlation
